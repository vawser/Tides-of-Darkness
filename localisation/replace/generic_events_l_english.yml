'As $PROVINCENAME$ continued to flourish under the benevolent rule of $COUNTRY$, the yokels on the other side of the border were bound to get jealous.' Perhaps they will be less fair to us.

Their dissatisfaction has grown to such an extent that violent revolts are becoming a common day practice. Even though there is no central leadership and they lack proper armament, the peasants have still managed to pose a challenge to the authority. Several important buildings, both religious and other, have been burnt and plundered as a protest."
 EVTOPTA3021: "Dire times are ahead of us"
 EVTNAMEHR22: "Peasant Protests"

 EVTOPTB3022: "Restrict serfdom"
 EVTNAMEHR23: "Religious Revolt"

The appeal is in many cases based on social motives, many believe that they will receive support and that their hardship will lessen. This isn't necessarily the case, as the revolt has gained momentum and atrocities at the hands of the peasants have become more widespread, the reformists have begun to oppose the 'murderous peasants'."

 EVTOPTB3023: "Let them choose their own faith"
 EVTNAMEHR24: "Obsolete Forces"
 EVTDESHOR24: "Military research and the introduction of gunpowder has more or less made our former armed forces obsolete.

 EVTNAMEHR25: "National Decentralization"
 EVTDESHOR25: "During the first stages of the Peasants' War, the rebels have gained ground simply by overwhelming the lords and knights.

 EVTDESHOR91: "$MONARCH$'s continuous scheming and plotting has infuriated the nobles and made $MONARCH$ some powerful enemies among the aristocracy.

 reforms.2.d: "Our country is going through an extensive social reorganization. Aristocratic lands are hugely being reduced and promises have been made to lessen the peasants' burden.

 EVTOPTA6337: "Give him the autonomy he wants."
 EVTDESSCR000: "A Eunuch who claims to hail from a northern border province has offered his services to the Imperial Court. The man is clearly of some talent, and can most likely be a boon to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ administration. However, accepting the aid of this man of statecraft will strengthen the Eunuch faction at court."
 EVTDESSCR102: "Your majesty has been presented with a formidable gift in the form of a Jade seal of some level of craftsmanship. The gift has been presented by an up and coming administrator associated with the Bureaucrat faction. As nothing is free in The Middle Kingdom, he probably expects us to return the favor."
 EVTDESSCR200: "The writings of Master Confucius are being forgotten in $PROVINCENAME$, as the inhabitants there have more and more taken to practicing the Buddhist rite. The news comes as a major setback for the Temple faction, which has prided itself on the successes of state-sanctioned Confucianism. We could dispatch officials to immediately restore order to the province, but forcing the locals into a different faith will most likely hurt the economic viability of the province."
 EVTDESSCR206: "Keeping the feet of young girls bound and tied until every bone in them has grown broken and deformed creates wonders of female and human beauty. The fashion of bound feet waxes and wanes every hundred years or so, and this time the wax seems to be due to the fact that the Temple faction is actively promoting this sound ideal of beauty all over the country."
 EVTDESSCR220: "A traveler from Tibet has arrived in $CAPITAL$. He says that he has traveled from far-away Lhasa, and that he comes to spread the word of the Buddha. The Temple faction opposes this request, preferring instead the traditional teachings of Confucius as the sole font of spiritual guidance for our people. While there is a case to be made for the Temple Faction's position, overly heavy-handed treatment of Buddhism will destabilize our country."
 EVTDESSCR222: "The Temple faction has had enough of the discord and strife that plagues $COUNTRY$. Pointing to the myriad of schools of thought that flourish within the realm it is no wonder, they argue, that we live in troubled times. The Temple faction holds that only a return to true Confucian values can restore order, and what better way than to burn a few books of heterodox teachings?"
 EVTDESSCR224: "The Temple faction, tired of the pluralistic thought climate that has taken hold in China in the past few years, has taken matter into its own hands. In several provinces all over the country several prominent scholars of other schools than the official Confucian doctrine have been buried alive. That this will be a blow to innovation is already clear, but how shall we punish the Temple?"
 EVTOPTSCR230: "A Scholar at the Examination Center"
 EVTDESSCR242: "Wrapped in the reddish gold of a dying sun, and reflecting the blue of the heavens suspended above it, the old Gilded Pagoda has stood since the times of the Tang dynasty, or perhaps even longer still. The silence and darkness within the Pagoda is a stark contrast to the light and reflection outside of. Since Buddhism has become rare, the Pagoda has gone unused, and your courtiers have various suggestions as to what could be done with it."
 EVTOPTSCR242: "Temples: Leave its beauty undisturbed"
 EVTOPTSCR300: "Stand and fight!"
 EVTDESSCR302: "A high ranking member of the Bureaucrat faction has been caught siphoning funds out of the Imperial Treasury and into his own pocket. The only punishment that can at all be considered is of course death, but the question of who should replace him is less obvious. There are powerful candidates within both the Eunuch and Temple factions, but the candidates from the Bureaucrat faction are doubtlessly the ones best equipped to handle the job. Who should get the job?"
 EVTOPTSCR302: "Sigh. Find a new Bureaucrat."
 EVTDESSCR306: "Since losing the Mandate of Heaven, people have begun avoiding you. It did not happen overnight, but progressively, as the months have passed, you have noticed that fewer and fewer people seem to take the time to pay their Emperor the proper respects and courtesies. After some cautious inquiries among trusted retainers you discover the reason: People have begun to fear you. For whatever reason, you have developed a reputation for cruelty. What to do about it?"
 EVTDESSCR316: "A scream echoes through the palace, but soon dissolves again into the silence and black of the night. A courtier has been murdered, found in his bedchamber with a blade buried deep in his back, and several stab wounds to the rest of his body. Fratricide and internal strife are becoming ever more common in $COUNTRY$, and many believe that we no longer enjoy the Mandate of Heaven. There are three suspects in the murder case, who did it?"
 EVTOPTSCR316: "The Grand Marshal, in the Bedchamber, with a knife."
 EVTDESSCR320: "They present your heir on a stretcher, lying dead before you. He had been out riding with some of his companions, and apparently fell off the horse. You can feel only a quiet rage welling up within you when you think of the futility of his death. The son of the Emperor, dead, not in war or battle, but from a pointless accident. The event is a clear sign that the Mandate of Heaven has passed from our dynasty, and that we need to regain it. His companions are from various factions, who should be punished for the incident?"
 EVTOPTSCR320: "The eunuch."
 EVTNAME750: "Bad Reputation!"

 EVTNAME754: "Legitimacy Questioned"
 EVTDESC754: "The bloodthirst shown by $MONARCH$ has ruined the reputation of $COUNTRY$ in the eyes of the world, and now our own subjects are starting to question the legitimacy of such a ruthless ruler."

 EVTDESC759: "Since the Tenth Century the Archbishops of Mainz have held the prestigious title of §YPrimas Germaniae§! - the most important Catholic Archbishop throughout the Dragon Aspects.\n\nNaturally, such a title will inspire jealousy among the other princes of the Empire... We must take heed and not let our prestige drop too low, or we might find the title slip from our fingers!"
 EVTNAME760: "Title of Primas Germaniae Questioned"

 EVTOPTA6197: "Excellent!"

According to our aristocrats it is also upsetting the men under their command, who expect to be led by their betters rather than by someone who is plainly not a gentleman."

 EVTDESC6108: "Our shipwrights are already excellent, but they are currently undergoing a burst of creativity that is leading to newer technical developments."
 EVTOPTA6108: "Who am I to stop them?"
 EVTNAME6109: "Concerned Shipwrights"
 EVTDESC6109: "For reasons we cannot fathom our shipwrights feel that they are not getting the backing and support for the Naval establishment. However ruling a nation is a lot of work, do we really care about such a minor matter?"
 EVTOPTA6109: "Why should I care about people who are so poor they have to work?"
 EVTOPTB6109: "Time to upset the Naval Establishment."
 EVTNAME6110: "We Rule the Waves"
 EVTDESC6110: "Our Glorious Navy is the pride of our Nation and the envy of the world."
 EVTOPTA6110: "More Glory for us."
 EVTNAME6111: "The Fleet has declined"
 EVTDESC6111: "No one can quite understand it. One minute we had a glorious navy that the whole nation took pride in. Now the world laughs at our fleet."
 EVTOPTA6111: "The Glory days will return."
 EVTOPTB6111: "A little money might sort things out."
 EVTNAME6112: "Recruits flock to the standards"
 EVTDESC6112: "Our system of national conscripts is proving very successful, the poor, the desperate, even the patriotic are flocking to the colors. The Generals are pleased."
 EVTOPTA6112: "Let's get them into the army now."
 EVTNAME6113: "People don't want to be conscripted"
 EVTDESC6113: "Usually our system of national conscripts functions like a well oiled machine, but at the moment we are encountering some resistance to recruitment. You know, riots, recruiting parties being attacked, minor things like that."
 EVTOPTA6113: "Well I am sure we can slow down recruitment in the short term"
 EVTOPTB6113: "Bah! I need soldiers, not whiners."
 EVTNAME6114: "Isn't our Army Grand?"
 EVTDESC6114: "Our Grand Army is so grand that it is marching from one victory to another. Experience from those victories positively impacts recruitment and training of new soldiers."
 EVTOPTA6114: "This is fantastic."
 EVTNAME6115: "Our Army is not so grand"
 EVTDESC6115: "One minute our army is the envy of the world, next no one has anything good to say about it. We have no idea how our grand army slipped so, but it could end up affecting recruitment."
 EVTOPTA6115: "Looks like recruitment will be a little harder."
 EVTOPTB6115: "Time to shake up the military establishment!"
 EVTNAME6116: "Military Improvements"
 EVTDESC6116: "Our Officers are experimenting with new ways to drill our, already superbly drilled, army. This seems to be raising the overall level of military thought in our nation."
 EVTOPTA6116: "I like military thinkers!"
 EVTNAME6117: "Military Complacency"
 EVTDESC6117: "Our superbly drilled army is in the opinion of our most influential generals invincible. Any recent defeats are down to the weather or the enemy using such unmanly things as tactics. As far as our generals are concerned there is no way to improve on perfection."
 EVTOPTA6117: "Invincible, I like the sound of it..."
 EVTOPTB6117: "I think the truth may upset some people."
 EVTNAME6130: "Promising General"
 EVTDESC6130: "Our policy of battlefield commissions has been very successful, a new general has emerged."
 EVTOPTA6130: "Well, he shows promise."
 EVTNAME6131: "Nobility concerned with the loss of privileges"
 EVTDESC6131: "Our policy of battlefield commissions is seriously concerning our nobles. They believe that just because a man shows some ability on the battlefield doesn't mean that he will be a good general. In fact it seems that life in the mess is becoming quite unbearable, as these new officers have no idea how a gentleman behaves. There are also rumors that the rank and file believe that a good leader ought to be better bred."
 EVTOPTA6131: "Does the nobility really matter?"
 EVTOPTB6131: "Well, I think making things a bit more difficult in the short term might be better."
 EVTNAME6132: "Glory of the Army"
 EVTDESC6132: "Our Glorious Army is enhancing the prestige of our nation."
 EVTOPTA6132: "Glory to us!"
 EVTNAME6133: "Our Army has seen better days"
 EVTDESC6133: "The tarnish seems to have come off the glory of our arms. People just aren't taking our army as seriously as before."
 EVTOPTA6133: "Time to shake things up then!"
 EVTOPTB6133: "I don't think there is much that can be done..."
 EVTNAME6134: "Our Merchants are adventuring"
 EVTDESC6134: "Current trading conditions are strongly favoring our merchants. Our merchants are ready to take advantage of these."
 EVTOPTA6134: "Excellent."
 EVTNAME6135: "Our Merchants are doing poorly"
 EVTDESC6135: "Although previously our adventuring merchants were doing good business, things have recently taken a turn for the worse."
 EVTOPTA6135: "I guess we'll just have to tighten our belts!"
 EVTOPTB6135: "A few unpopular reforms are the answer."
 EVTNAME6136: "Expeditioner Rush"
 EVTDESC6136: "Rumors of our Quest for the New World have led to more people readying themselves for a new life as a colonial settler."
 EVTOPTA6136: "They might be useful."
 EVTNAME6137: "People Flee to the Expeditions"
 EVTDESC6137: "Our Quest for the New World has opened up opportunities for people in our colonies. The continuing war has convinced many of the best and brightest that the time to take these opportunities is now."
 EVTOPTA6137: "Let them go."
 EVTOPTB6137: "They must be stopped."
 EVTNAME6139: "Colonial Company goes bankrupt"
 EVTDESC6139: "One of colonial ventures has run into serious financial trouble, if no action is taken the colonists could suffer."

 EVTNAME6141: "Trade Complacency"
 EVTDESC6141: "Although as a nation we are famous for our shrewd commerce practices, at the moment our merchants are becoming a tad complacent."

 EVTNAME6142: "Excellent Viceroys"

 EVTOPTA6142: "We are pleased to hear this."
 EVTNAME6143: "Corrupt Viceroys"
 EVTDESC6143: "Overseas provinces are notoriously too hard to police and good viceroys are essential. Sometimes though things don't work according to the plan, and corrupt and venal men end up in charge."
 EVTOPTA6143: "Take action."
 EVTOPTB6143: "Just turn a blind eye."
 EVTNAME6144: "Production Improvements"
 EVTDESC6144: "Our embracing of Smithian Economics has led to people spending time thinking about how things are produced. For the moment it seems to have paid off."
 EVTOPTA6144: "This is good."
 EVTNAME6145: "Production Stifled"
 EVTDESC6145: "Our producers become complacent as our use of Smithian Economics led to our production techniques being so advanced."
 EVTOPTA6145: "I think this will hurt production."
 EVTOPTB6145: "Actually it seems to have translated into higher prices."
 EVTNAME6146: "Successful Bureaucracy"
 EVTDESC6146: "On an annual basis bureaucracy gives the country a nice little tax boost, but sometimes the right men in the right place can give the country that little bit extra. It is a shame that a few years down the line you have to promote them beyond their ability."
 EVTOPTA6146: "Make hay while the sun shines."
 EVTNAME6147: "Corrupt Bureaucracy"
 EVTDESC6147: "Bureaucracy sometimes just doesn't work. The wrong men in the wrong places can lead to corrupt practices which hurt the country's income. Even worse, it will take a few years to get the proper paperwork to change it."
 EVTOPTA6147: "You just can't fight the system."
 EVTNAME6148: "National Bank pays dividends"
 EVTDESC6148: "Several shrewd loans have led to very good profits at our National Bank. The bank is hiking its dividend and buying back some of its shares."
 EVTOPTA6148: "We're in the money."
 EVTNAME6149: "National Bank in trouble"
 EVTDESC6149: "Our National Bank is doing very poorly. It is finding it hard to lend to reliable people and is running into difficulties."

 EVTNAME6150: "Trade Policy Success"
 EVTDESC6150: "Our National Trade Policy is proving unusually successful at the moment. This is giving our merchants a real boost."
 EVTOPTA6150: "I am sure this is good news."
 EVTNAME6151: "Trade Policy is failing"
 EVTDESC6151: "Our National Trade Policy isn't really delivering at the moment. Our merchant just aren't doing as well."

 EVTOPTB6151: "We should grease the wheels a little more..."
 EVTNAME6152: "New Spy techniques"
 EVTDESC6152: "Our Espionage system is performing and our agents have found new ways to spy on people. Sooner or later our 'friends' and enemies will find out, but for the moment we have an edge."

 EVTNAME6154: "Cabinet Dynamism"

 EVTNAME6157: "Backlash"
 EVTDESC6157: "Since we introduced the Bill of Rights many of our original ruling classes have been feeling marginalized, however, rather than discuss it they seem to be staging a revolt."
 EVTOPTA6157: "Why don't they just discuss this like gentlemen?"
 EVTNAME6158: "The Clergy Mobilizes Population"
 EVTDESC6158: "For many years our policies have motivated a large majority of our population to dutifully attend the expected religious ceremonies. The clergy has shown its thanks for our supportive policy by in turn making supportive comments about our government."

 EVTDESC6196: "We have often made it clear that the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith is the one true faith, ensuring our people that a war against [infidel_neighbor.GetName] is imminent, considering our religious differences. However, many of our subjects are currently disappointed in us as we have failed to pursue any kind of war against our neighbors of [infidel_neighbor.GetName]. Some take to the streets to show their discontent."

 EVTDESWWR14: "As we remain wedded to the doctrine of offensive action, some of our fortifications are suffering."
 EVTDESWWR15: "The offensive nature of our armed forces means that local commanders are not concerned with the status of local fortifications."

 EVTDESWWR20: "Due to us favoring defensive tactics, a local commander has decided to upgrade his fortification."
 EVTDESWWR21: "Our focus on the defense has left local commanders thinking that improving fortification is the proper use of their time."
 EVTDESWWR22: "A local commander, taking his cue from our focus on the defense, has decided to improve a local fortification."
 EVTDESWWR23: "As we committed to the defense, local commanders feel that it would be all round safer if they put more troops in forts, rather than waste them on the battlefield."
 EVTDESWWR24: "With our focus on the defensive, a local commander has taken it on himself to maximize the fortification level of our province."
 EVTNAME6325: "Generals Concerned by our unmanly tactics"
 EVTDESWWR25: "Our focus on the defensive is robbing our units of the élan they need to be truly successful on the battlefield. Our generals are deeply concerned about this, and there are rumors that other countries snigger about us behind our back."

 EVTNAMKAM1: "Sale of Titles"
 EVTDESGNR1: "My lord, one of your advisors has suggested selling off titles of nobility to anyone who can afford to pay. It could bring in lots of money and open a way for social advancement for the rich if we do, but it would devalue the idea of nobility and perhaps upset the existing aristocratic families. Should we do this?"
 EVTNAMKAM2: "A traveling minstrel"

 EVTNAMKAM4: "Tensions between nobles and clergy"
 EVTDESGNR4: "In feudal kingdoms two castes within society held great power. The nobility and the clergy. Now it turns out a baron and the local monastery of his fief are bickering about who owns a rather large piece of land. These days the royal court is swamped with people yammering about divine right. The nobles claiming their divine right to rule the land and the clergy asserting their position as the representatives of God on Earth. The whole situation is growing rather unstable, the baron in question is inciting the other nobles against the clergy and questioning their right to hold any sort of temporal property. The prior of the monastery has brought in the archbishop on his side, who in turn threatens to go straight to Rome should you decide to side with the nobles. Now, what shall we do, my liege?"
 EVTNAMKAM5: "The Maid of $CAPITAL_CITY$"
 EVTDESGNR5: "My lord, a peasant girl from the region of $CAPITAL$ has arrived at your court. She claims to have received a divine vision, where God commanded her to take command of your armies and drive the hated invaders from our lands! Some of your ministers are laughing at her"

 EVTNAMKAM6: "Bible printed!"
 EVTDESGNR6: "A talented inventor of our country made something many considered impossible. He managed to devise a method that allows him to build a press to print huge amounts of copies of the Holy Bible, allowing every Christian to have one and rendering many monks across the world jobless. He started with the Bible but soon other books will be printed to spread enlightenment across the continent. As classics are rediscovered in Europe, the whole continent is going to change forever."

The advisor dares to denounce our great $MONARCHTITLE$'s policies and recently did so in public in front of foreign ambassadors. Even if there might be some grounds for these criticisms, we shouldn't let open criticism of the $MONARCHTITLE$ become a habit of anyone."
 EVTNAMKAM9: "Privateers bring profits"

Others are convinced that the risks are too great and that more money could be made at home."
 EVTDESC9553: "Our Parliament is divided regarding the proposal to establish a new trade node. Most of them can't see any logical reason to why such a prominent trading nation as our own shouldn't have its own trade node, but as we all know, these things don't come cheap and therefore require careful consideration."
 EVTDESC753: "Apparently citing disgust with $COUNTRY$'s endless wars of conquest some Trade Nodes have decided to expel our merchants."
 EVTDESC773: "Some countries are apparently so appalled by our foreign policy that they've decided to retaliate by assassinating our merchants in an attempt to strike at our finances!\n\nWhat makes it even more shocking is that it happens even in our own Trade Nodes..."
 EVTNAME700: "Election!"
 EVTDESC700: "The term is up for $MONARCH$. With enough support [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] can stay in office, but then [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] must defeat [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] three primary competitors..."

 EVTNAME9520: "Abolition of Slavery"
 EVTDESC9520: "As slavery has been abolished in $COUNTRY$, all subjects, even in remote regions need to find another way to earn their living. Hopefully our traders can figure out another thing that is as profitable."
 EVTOPTA9520: "Let my people go!"
 EVTNAME610: "Integrating $FROMCOUNTRY$"
 EVTDESC610: "When a smaller country gives up its independence to join a greater realm, there is a lot of adapting, and while some parts are easy, the administration of the realm will still need to expand to accommodate all possibilities."
 EVTOPTB610A: "Integration is a slow process."
 EVTNAME9550: "Trade Focus"
 EVTDESC9550: "Some members of our parliament feel that we're not putting enough focus on national trade. It's pretty clear to everyone that we're not exactly dominating trade in this area but we could certainly do worse, at least that's what the other members are claiming. If our previous track record is anything to go by, our parliament are not very likely to come to any sort of agreement anytime soon unless someone is able to talk some sense into them."
 EVTOPTA9550: "We need more merchants"
 EVTOPTB9550: "It's efficiency we lack"
 EVTNAME9551: "Trade Expansion"
 EVTOPTA9551: "Local trade is where our focus should be"
 EVTOPTB9551: "Perhaps it's time to broaden our horizons"
 EVTNAME9552: "Budgetary Disagreements"
 EVTDESC9552: "Our parliament seems to have some real difficulties coming to terms with how to govern our nation, whether it's agreeing on a budget, taxes, port duties or trade and customs policies. This time it's the budget, should more money be invested into research or be set aside for unforeseen expenses in the future?"
 EVTOPTA9552: "Invest it all in research"
 EVTOPTB9552: "Save some for future expenses"
 EVTNAME9553: "Disagreements in the Parliament"
 EVTOPTA9553: "Try to mediate between the two parties"
 EVTOPTB9553: "Propose some other changes"
 EVTNAME9554: "Misdirected Focus"
 EVTDESC9554: "A few members of our parliament are convinced that we're putting too much focus on military operations instead of concentrating on expanding our trade. They are complaining that too many investments are being directed into financing our military but almost nothing to improve our trade conditions."
 EVTOPTA9554: "It's all according to plan"
 EVTOPTB9554: "Perhaps our focus has been a bit misdirected"
 EVTNAME9555: "Parliamentary Problems"
 EVTDESC9555: "$STATESMAN$ has been quite busy lately, proposing new changes, one after the other. Although you could argue that they are only doing their job, their constant interference and attitude of 'knowing it all' in any matter even remotely related to politics is causing quite a rift in our parliament, there are even those that think we would do better without $STATESMAN$."
 EVTOPTA9555: "Find someone to replace $STATESMAN_S_PRONOUN$."
 EVTOPTB9555: "Give the advisor another chance"
 EVTNAME9556: "Heated Debates"
 EVTDESC9556: "Some members of the parliament are having some concerns regarding our increasingly bad reputation, they are claiming that it's having a negative effect on our trade relations. This question has been raised numerous times in the past but not that many have thought it of any consequence. This time the matter is causing some really heated debates though, perhaps we should try to settle things before they get out of hand."
 EVTOPTA9556: "That is probably wise"
 EVTOPTB9556: "It's not really a problem"
 EVTNAME9557: "Offense or Defense"
 EVTDESC9557: "The ongoing war has led to some serious conflicts in parliament. On the one side there are those arguing that there is nothing to be gained by allowing the war to drag on while others are convinced that there's no turning back. Unfortunately their inability to come to some sort of agreement does nothing to improve our current situation but rather the contrary."
 EVTOPTA9557: "Offense is probably the only option"
 EVTOPTB9557: "Defense sounds better at this stage"
 EVTNAME9558: "Conflicting Opinions"
 EVTDESC9558: "It seems there is always a small group of the parliament that can't agree with the others. Regardless of the matter at hand this particular group always have a different opinion than everyone else."
 EVTOPTA9558: "It's probably best to leave things as they are"
 EVTOPTB9558: "Some restructuring might be needed"
 EVTNAME9559: "An infiltrator in Parliament"
 EVTDESC9559: "There is a spy among us! Somehow a spy has managed to infiltrate our parliament and all of a sudden everyone is a suspect. We haven't managed to find out who sent him yet but since our relations with some of our neighbors are somewhat strained at the moment it was probably one of them."
 EVTOPTA9559: "That's not possible"
 EVTOPTB9559: "That's the only reasonable explanation"
 EVTNAME9560: "A Traitor in the Parliament"
 EVTDESC9560: "It would appear as though a member of our parliament has been selling secrets to our enemies. How would you otherwise explain the fact that they all of a sudden seem able to predict our every move? These were decisions that were never discussed outside the Parliament building."
 EVTOPTA9560: "Of course it was one of them"
 EVTOPTB9560: "It's better to play it safe until we know more"
 EVTNAME9561: "Political Chaos"
 EVTDESC9561: "Our Parliament's indecisiveness and inability to make any kind of decision has created near chaos. Every member is trying their utmost to get their voice heard but refusing to acknowledge the opinions of anyone else."
 EVTOPTA9561: "That's just the nature of politics"
 EVTOPTB9561: "Some restructuring might be necessary"
 EVTNAME9562: "Influenced Decisions"
 EVTDESC9562: "It has been brought to your attention that a certain member of our Parliament has been accepting bribes from several different sources for influencing all kinds of national decisions."
 EVTOPTA9562: "It has to stop"
 EVTOPTB9562: "That can't be true"
 EVTNAME9563: "Financial Disagreements"
 EVTDESC9563: "Our economy isn't what it has been. The treasury is almost empty and our parliament can't seem to figure out how to handle the situation or the reasons for it to happen in the first place. Minting more money is always an option of course or raising taxes, either way they are waiting for you to make a decision."
 EVTOPTA9563: "Mint more money"
 EVTOPTB9563: "Raise taxes"
 EVTNAME9564: "Military Spending"
 EVTDESC9564: "Some members of parliament are complaining that we're spending too much money on our military. Many of them are convinced that our production and trade will suffer if we don't cut back on military expenses."
 EVTOPTA9564: "Well, trade and production aren't as important"
 EVTOPTB9564: "Cut back on military expenses"
 EVTNAME9565: "A Strong Army or Navy?"
 EVTDESC9565: "Our Parliament is divided in regards to our military focus, some of them are advocating for a grand navy while others are more interested in a large army. Although some sort of middle way would be possible, most of them would prefer that we increased the size of our navy."
 EVTOPTA9565: "A large navy is the only option"
 EVTOPTB9565: "A large army would be more beneficial"
 EVTNAME9566: "Military Leniency"
 EVTDESC9566: "Some members of our parliament feel that we are too lenient when it comes to asserting control over what is rightfully ours. They can't understand how we can allow a core province like $PROVINCENAME$ to be controlled by some other country and just sit idly by."
 EVTOPTA9566: "They fail to see the bigger picture"
 EVTOPTB9566: "It's not of any interest anymore"
 EVTNAME9567: "Too many liberties"
 EVTDESC9567: "A few members of our parliament are of the opinion that $MONARCH$ has been taking a few too many liberties lately when it comes to governing our nation. Some are even claiming that $MONARCH$ seem to lack any respect whatsoever for both the constitution and the rest of the parliament."
 EVTOPTA9567: "They are exaggerating"
 EVTOPTB9567: "Take appropriate measurements"
 EVTNAME9568: "Economic Decisions"
 EVTDESC9568: "Our parliament is constantly exploring different ways to bring more money into our state treasury but as always there are disagreements regarding the best strategy. A heavy tax raise would improve the state of our treasury considerably but it is also very likely to upset the populace, a small raise on the other hand wouldn't improve our finances as much but wouldn't cause that many protests either."
 EVTOPTA9568: "A short-term solution is probably the best option"
 EVTOPTB9568: "Consider the long-term consequences"
 EVTNAME9569: "Military Expenses"
 EVTDESC9569: "Several members of our parliament are complaining that the costs of maintaining such a large army are too big for our current budget."
 EVTOPTA9569: "Convince them that we can afford it"
 EVTOPTB9569: "Agree to make some cutbacks"
 EVTNAME9570: "Sympathizers of the Old Government"
 EVTDESC9570: "It would appear as though a few members of our parliament still sympathize with the former government. Neither of them will admit it of course, but their behavior is rather suspicious at times. It might be a good idea to investigate where their real allegiances lay."
 EVTOPTA9570: "That won't be necessary"
 EVTOPTB9570: "Get to it"
 EVTNAME9571: "A New Constitution"
 EVTDESC9571: "Despite the considerable time and effort dedicated to the establishment of a new constitution, our parliament can't seem to agree on a common goal. So far, not a single proposition has been accepted by all parties and all normal activities have come to a standstill."
 EVTOPTA9571: "It will be solved soon enough"
 EVTOPTB9571: "Request some help"
 EVTNAME9572: "Areas of Research"
 EVTDESC9572: "Every member of our parliament is requesting more money to be invested in a different area. Our army needs funding but so does our trade and production and let's not forget about our navy."
 EVTOPTA9572: "An even spread should do the trick"
 EVTOPTB9572: "There's no need for any extra investments"
 EVTNAME9573: "Lack of Support"
 EVTDESC9573: "Some members of our parliament seem to think that $MONARCH$ has held his office long enough and are arguing for a new election. Apparently the reason for this is grounded in a disagreement they had with $MONARCH$ a short while ago regarding the implementation of a new financial reform."
 EVTOPTA9573: "Ignore them"
 EVTOPTB9573: "Agree to hear them out once more"
 EVTNAME9574: "Anxious Parliament"
 EVTDESC9574: "$SPYMASTER$, always being a rather suspicious person has managed to convince several members of parliament that a counter revolution is under works. $SPYMASTER_CAP_ADJ$ doesn't have any real evidence so far but most members seem to take $SPYMASTER_S_PRONOUN$ seriously and are therefore demanding appropriate measures to be taken."
 EVTOPTA9574: "It's nothing to worry about"
 EVTOPTB9574: "It's better to be safe than sorry"
 EVTNAME9575: "Troublesome Parliament"
 EVTDESC9575: "Our parliament seems to have some difficulties understanding who's in charge of our government. They seem to think it's fully acceptable to make decisions without either informing or discussing the matter with you first. Whatever gave them that idea?"
 EVTOPTA9575: "Make it a bit more clear to them"
 EVTOPTB9575: "Let them think they have a say in things"
 EVTNAME9576: "Overspending"
 EVTDESC9576: "$TREASURER$ has been complaining constantly for the last few weeks that we're spending more money than our budget allows. $TREASURER_CAP_ADJ$ has always been a bit overdramatic of course but this time $TREASURER_ADJ$ has even managed to convince some of the other members of parliament that it's a real problem."
 EVTOPTA9576: "Try to convince $TREASURER_O_PRONOUN$ otherwise"
 EVTOPTB9576: "Let $TREASURER_O_PRONOUN$ worry"
 EVTNAME9577: "Embezzlement"
 EVTDESC9577: "It's becoming more and more clear to you that there aren't that many members of the parliament that you can really trust. One of your closest advisors has just been exposed stealing money from the state treasury."
 EVTOPTA9577: "There's probably a good explanation for this"
 EVTOPTB9577: "Get rid of them"
 EVTNAME9578: "Planned Coup"
 EVTDESC9578: "According to some fairly trustworthy sources a few members of parliament are planning a coup to have $MONARCH$ replaced. It might be wise to investigate the matter further."
 EVTOPTA9578: "You can never be too careful"
 EVTOPTB9578: "They wouldn't dare!"
 EVTNAME9579: "Possible Traitors"
 EVTDESC9579: "There are some rumors floating around that certain members of our parliament are actually spies sent by a rivaling nation to infiltrate our government. Apparently you can't trust anyone."
 EVTOPTA9579: "Confront them"
 EVTOPTB9579: "Send a few spies of your own"
 EVTNAME2060: "Missionary Falls Ill"
 EVTDESC2060: "The missionary we sent to $PROVINCENAME$ hasn't had much luck so far, news have just reached us that he has fallen ill. Any further work on the new church has come to a standstill and without his guidance the chances of converting the locals are rather slim."
 EVTOPTA2060: "Send someone to assist him"
 EVTOPTB2060: "Direct your efforts elsewhere"
 EVTNAME2061: "Religious Resistance"
 EVTDESC2061: "It is proving much harder than anticipated to convert the citizens of $PROVINCENAME$. Although a few of them showed some clear interest in the beginning, the majority don't seem that willing to embrace a new religion."
 EVTOPTA2061: "Increase your efforts"
 EVTOPTB2061: "It's a waste of time"
 EVTNAME2062: "Native Attack"
 EVTDESC2062: "We have just received news regarding the missionary we sent to $PROVINCENAME$. According to the report he and his followers were attacked by natives just a short while ago. Unfortunately it's not clear if they managed to drive the attackers away or if they still pose a threat."
 EVTOPTA2062: "Send some troops and supplies just in case"
 EVTOPTB2062: "They can probably handle this themselves"
 EVTNAME2063: "Religious Uproar"
 EVTDESC2063: "According to the governor of $PROVINCENAME$, the citizens are in uproar because of our missionaries' complete lack of respect for any religious practices or traditions different from their own. He is asking us to consider canceling all further missionary activities in the area or at least send some more troops until things calm down a bit."
 EVTOPTA2063: "Send some troops"
 EVTOPTB2063: "It's not of much importance"
 EVTNAME2064: "Wicked Rumors"
 EVTDESC2064: "There are some very disturbing rumors circulating regarding the missionary we sent to $PROVINCENAME$. According to the rumors he never used the money we gave him to finance the construction of a new church but kept it all to himself. Who would have thought such a godly man could be capable of such a thing."
 EVTOPTA2064: "Find out if it's true"
 EVTOPTB2064: "There's no reason to doubt a man of god"
 EVTNAME2065: "Religious Tensions"
 EVTDESC2065: "The situation in $PROVINCENAME$ is getting close to unbearable. The citizens are refusing to accept the preaching of the missionary we sent there a short while ago and now he fears for his life. A revolt seems imminent unless we do something soon."
 EVTOPTA2065: "Take your chances"
 EVTOPTB2065: "Do what you can"
 EVTNAME2066: "Neighbor Disrupting the Peace"
 EVTDESC2066: "The missionary we sent to $PROVINCENAME$ is complaining that the area is too unstable at the moment. Despite our neutral stance, the war that is currently going on in the neighboring country is having an impact on $PROVINCENAME$ too."
 EVTOPTA2066: "Offer him some more money"
 EVTOPTB2066: "Offer him some help"
 EVTOPTC2066: "Don't worry about it"
 EVTNAME2067: "Missionary Activities"
 EVTDESC2067: "Our theologian is complaining that not enough money is invested in missionary activities. One missionary is hardly enough to convert the whole population of $PROVINCENAME$ for instance."
 EVTOPTA2067: "Perhaps he's right"
 EVTOPTB2067: "It's more than enough"
 EVTDESC1423: "These so called pilgrims are following the [heretics_from_here.Religion.GetName] faith, which is an abomination to our $COUNTRY_RELIGION$ church. They are following a wicked faith and will most likely perish in the colonies.\nStill they have managed to gain the support of many of our settlers and have made a new home for themselves in this faraway land."

 EVTDESC801: "Strengthening the burghers and merchants at the cost of the gentry lessens our prestige in the eyes of the world. We are losing face, and risk becoming a nation of greedy moneygrubbers."
 EVTOPTB801A: "What do we care?"
 EVTNAMAWR2: "Merchants Benefit"
 EVTDESC802: "When the position of burghers and merchants is strengthened in a country, there will be more competent people available for state duty. Sometimes a country can benefit even from the talents of the common folk."
 EVTOPTB802A: "One Great Man will serve us!"
 EVTNAMAWR3: "Loss of Stability"
 EVTDESC803: "This strengthening of the privileges of the nobles is severely upsetting the burghers and merchants. This is creating turmoil in our realm, and may prove disastrous in the long run."
 EVTOPTA803: "Well, they are just peasants."
 EVTNAMAWR4: "The Burghers Rise!"
 EVTDESC804: "The Burghers are rising against the changes in our country, which have limited their powers. Clearly, they are not happy with having the privileges of the nobility strengthened."
 EVTOPTB804A: "Rely on the Nobility."
 EVTNAMAWR5: "More Nobility in the Army"
 EVTDESC805: "With the increased privileges of the aristocracy come additional duties. A true nobleman is expected to serve in the army as an officer and a gentleman."

 EVTOPTB809A: "Excellent work"
 EVTNAME810: "More Local Recruiting"
 EVTDESC810: "Our decision to ensure that local privileges will be honored has meant that peasants are keen to defend their villages. This in turn has the added benefit of people being less resentful about serving in our military."
 EVTOPTB810A: "We are pleased"
 EVTNAME811: "Stability Increase"
 EVTDESC811: "Our decision to give more power to local magnates has ensured that people of importance feel good about our government. So, they have been telling everyone else how well they are being governed."
 EVTOPTB811A: "Good news"
 EVTNAME812: "Peasant Revolt"
 EVTDESC812: "One of the good things about serfdom is that by ensuring that peasants cannot move around they become easier to tax. However, some peasants seem to have issues with this just and natural policy, so they have foolishly decided to revolt."
 EVTOPTB812A: "Kill them All!"
 EVTNAME813: "Attracting the right people"
 EVTDESC813: "By assisting our nobles in confining the serfs to their lands we have greatly enriched the landed aristocracy. A wealthy nobility is one that can devote time to life's higher pursuits and the lesser sons of any house of respect will count a great number of loyal and able artists, administrators or other men of quality among their scions. Some are quite eager to pay the state back for the service it has done to their families."
 EVTOPTB813A: "This is good"
 EVTNAME814: "Major Revolt"
 EVTDESC814: "Our Peasants are deeply upset at the news that their freedom of movement is to be further restricted. In fact, there have been massive revolts across our country because of this... Perhaps if they took the time to care for their personal hygiene they would not be so revolting? "
 EVTOPTB814A: "The peasants are revolting!"
 EVTNAME815: "People are disappearing"
 EVTDESC815: "Since we have made it easier for the peasants to move around in search of better farming opportunities, it has, unfortunately, been more difficult to track them down when the army needs recruits."
 EVTOPTA815: "Not ideal this"
 EVTNAME816: "Losing control"
 EVTDESC816: "With our new laws that tie the peasantry less firmly to the land, it seems that they are also getting strange new ideas about their precise role in the grand scheme of things."
 EVTOPTB816A: "This is a worrying development"
 EVTNAME817: "Better Administration"
 EVTDESC817: "By reining in the nobility in their ruthless exploitation of the peasantry, so called 'gentleman farmers' have become surprisingly common in the administration. This, in turn, has improved general conditions in our country."
 EVTOPTB817A: "Progress!"
 EVTNAME818: "Dangerous ideas are spreading!"
 EVTDESC818: "Our slightly less dogmatic thinking has led to new and strange notions of 'humanism'. This is a cause for deep concern, since people are starting to question the proper order of things."
 EVTOPTB818A: "We are concerned."
 EVTNAME819: "We look weak"
 EVTDESC819: "Properly civilized countries do not allow petty commoners to attempt any kind of serious thought. The eyes of the world are upon us, and the world does not like what it sees."
 EVTOPTB819A: "It is temporary"
 EVTNAMNDR0: "New thinkers arise"
 EVTDESC820: "Our generous policies allowing people more freedom of speech have created a fertile breeding ground for promising new ideas. Some of the prominent new thinkers might become great men, who will eventually leave our nation with a lasting legacy of intellectual growth."
 EVTOPTB820A: "We have chosen wisely"
 EVTNAMNDR1: "Heresy"
 EVTDESC821: "Somehow, it seems like for every nest of heretics we root out and purge, another two spring up."
 EVTOPTB821A: "Weeds in the garden..."
 EVTNAMNDR2: "Disorder"
 EVTDESC822: "Not everybody agrees with our religious doctrine. Some people are complaining loudly, calling our approach to modern ideas narrow-minded and arguing that clinging to ancient philosophy is regressive nonsense."
 EVTOPTB822A: "Alas, some might have to burn..."
 EVTNAMNDR3: "A Holy Person Has Arrived"
 EVTDESC823: "A person from a holy order arrived at court today, impressed with our harsh, but just and Godly, punishment of heretics and unbelievers. They have asked for an advisory position, stating that a [Root.GovernmentName] that prays together will stay together."
 EVTOPTB823A: "Let me think about this."
 EVTNAME830: "Nobles are worried"
 EVTDESC830: "Our nobles with estates close to the frontier are concerned that we are neglecting our defenses. They have voiced their worries to all and sundry."
 EVTOPTB830A: "But attack is the best form of defense!"
 EVTNAME831: "Too many cowards"
 EVTDESC831: "Our increasing focus on offensive doctrine has made it harder to find brave peasants to fill the ranks. Ridiculous complaints about being cannon fodder are frequently spouted to our recruitment officers."
 EVTOPTB831A: "The fools are missing out on glory"
 EVTNAME832: "Glory to us"
 EVTDESC832: "Our decision to focus on offense has led too many of our neighbors looking enviously and worriedly at our glorious troops, who stand ready to give our enemies a taste of cold steel."
 EVTOPTB832A: "Indeed"
 EVTNAME833: "Aristocrats don't want to serve"
 EVTDESC833: "Our Aristocrats are becoming reluctant to serve in our army since we are focusing on defensive tactics. They are concerned about the lack of opportunities for glory while cowering behind fortifications."
 EVTOPTB833A: "They just don't understand"
 EVTOPTB833B: "A little gold will convince them"
 EVTNAME834: "Peasants upset"
 EVTDESC834: "With our increasing focus on defense, we have been clearing land around our fortifications to dig moats and create clear fields of fire. The people occupying some of the land have reacted in a most disloyal manner."
 EVTOPTB834A: "Well, the fort should hold out till relief arrives."
 EVTNAME835: "Fortification Expert"
 EVTDESC835: "Since we have started to focus on more defensive philosophies, a humble engineer (a position usually at the bottom of the rung in the military) has had a chance to impress with the mark of true genius."
 EVTOPTB835A: "He is pretty good I guess..."
 ideagroups.802.b: "Let him improve defenses in his home province."
 EVTOPTB836A: "To be expected"
 EVTOPTB837A: "Damn"
 EVTOPTB838A: "Interesting."
 EVTNAME839: "Arsenals are being deserted"
 EVTDESC839: "Since we have decided to increase our focus on naval matters, our military arsenals supplying the Army are being deserted. Experienced craftsmen are seeking employment elsewhere."
 EVTOPTB839A: "Disappointing"
 EVTNAME840: "General retires"
 EVTDESC840: "The recent decision to favor the Navy more has caused several generals to seek retirement. They feel that there will be less glory for them."
 EVTOPTB840A: "Oh well"
 EVTNAME842: "Unsuitable recruits"
 EVTDESC842: "Since we have felt it necessary to tighten up the quality standards of our army, a whole host of potential recruits must regrettably be declared unfit for duty."
 EVTOPTB842A: "We must separate the wheat from the chaff "
 EVTNAME843: "[Root.GetNoblesReplacementForOtherGovernments] worried"
 EVTDESC843: "With our army increasingly focused on quality, there are concerns that the traditional army - loyal to them first and the country second - is gone forever. Fortunately, they are even more worried that this new model army will prove a most compelling argument against any overly loud complaints... [Root.GetNoblesReplacementForOtherGovernments] are especially worried that their positions may be threatened."
 EVTOPTB843A: "There is nothing to worry about"
 EVTNAME844: "New commandant"
 EVTDESC844: "Since we are looking for a more disciplined army, our commandants are working hard at making sure our troops are drilled to perfection. One man in particular shows real promise."
 EVTOPTB844A: "Very Good"
 EVTNAME845: "People laugh at our army"
 EVTDESC845: "Although the decision to go for a massed army makes sense to many inside our country, uncouth foreigners are laughing at us, saying our army is nothing but an undisciplined mob."
 EVTOPTB845A: "Let them laugh."
 EVTNAME846: "Leaders harder to find"
 EVTDESC846: "We have made the wise decision to favor quantity over quality. However, the new larger army has the unforeseen problem of finding it harder to spot officers of talent among the masses."
 EVTOPTB846A: "Things will no doubt improve"
 EVTNAME847: "New organization"
 EVTDESC847: "Some thought that our decision to favor quantity over quality was foolish, that it would lead to a decline in leadership, or even make our army a bit of a joke - but they were wrong. Our new larger army has unlocked the talents of our military minds, leading to ever better levels of organization."
 EVTOPTB847A: "Nice "
 EVTDESFER0: "People are finding lots of ways of getting around paying taxes and fees on moving goods. This is cutting into our income, but stopping it would cost quite a lot in the short-term."
 EVTDESFER1: "Since the invention of the printing press, more and more books, about an ever wider range of subjects, have been published. We can now see the benefit of this, since knowledge spreads faster and more ideas are appearing amongst our philosophers and natural scientists."
 EVTDESFER2: "We are at war, and our manpower reserves are slowly disappearing. Our great and competent ruler has come up with a plan to recruit more men for military duties. However, this may cause problems in the countryside."
 EVTDESFER3: "The high war exhaustion in our country is wreaking all sorts of havoc with the state. Everyone from the highest noble to the most common serf is feeling the strain of continuing this clearly pointless war."
 EVTDESFER4: "Is is clear that we are fighting a losing war, and that we should cut our losses and sign a dignified peace. Continuing to fight like this only makes us look insane."
 EVTDESFER5: "The abysmal handling of this war has caused several pretenders to emerge. One of them is now even taking up arms against us in the middle of a war."
 EVTDESFER6: "The local authorities in $PROVINCENAME$ have no problem adapting to the new rules and laws of the occupier. Now, due to the disastrous progress of this war, they have already accepted the foregone conclusion of their transfer at the peace table, and have defected."
