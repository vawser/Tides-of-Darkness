Alexstrasza brought an enchanted acorn, a remnant of G'hanir, and placed it in the well, where it grew into Nordrassil, the first world tree. This tree would serve as a means to regulate the power of the new Well masking its energies ingeniously from radiating out into the Twisting Nether to serve as another beacon for the Legion. The tree would also mask its power signature from would-be magic users in the hope of preventing any other society from learning arcane secrets and repeating the disastrous error of the elves. The tree would forever serve as a symbol of the connection between the arcane and nature, the night elves and the natural world, and would use the energies from the well to heal the world after the devastation of the Sundering. Partly in reward for their effort in repelling the Legion invasion, Nozdormu then blessed tree, so that, as long as the tree stood, the night elves would never age or fall prey to disease. Ysera also placed an enchantment upon the World Tree by linking the spirits of the night elves to her own realm, the ethereal dimension known as the Emerald Dream. The night elf druids, including Furion himself, were bound to the Dream through the World Tree. As part of the mystical pact, the druids agreed to sleep for centuries at a time so that their spirits could roam the infinite paths of Ysera's Dreamways and the spirits of the night elves.

 thalassian_ideas_1_desc: "#The first king of the High elves Dath Remar Sunstrider led the exile of the highborne and set the way for a dynasty that would rule Quel'Thalas for millennia, it is said that while a Sunstrider holds the throne Silvermoon has nothing to fear."
 thalassian_ideas_2: "The exile of the Highborne"
 thalassian_ideas_2_desc: "The Highborne soon grew bold in defying the new laws against arcane magic. They would not bow to the hysterical fears of the lower-caste majority. The Highborne felt they had taken all the necessary precautions by resolving to be more cautious than their predecessors. After all, the Highborne had no desire to bring about another Sundering. Rather than execute the Highborne, the rest of the night elves sentenced them to exile after they had unleashed a terrible magical storm over Ashenvale. The Highborne were thoroughly exasperated by what they saw as a foolish overreaction against sorcery. They were therefore not unhappy at the prospect of exile; on the contrary, they looked forward to it. Thinking ahead, they contrived to steal one of the magical vials that had been confiscated from Illidan"

In the Sunwell's light, Quel'Thalas grew mighty, becoming a beacon of power in the Eastern Kingdoms.[8] Yet, the boons it granted were not without a price: the high elves, constantly bathed in the Sunwell's power every moment of every day, became addicted to its energies. Here it shall be. We will have our glory again, and this will give it to us. So much power... The power of the Well of Eternity, transformed with our guidance into something greater yet - Dath'Remar Sunstrider"
 thalassian_ideas_4: "Bandinoriel and the Runestones"
 thalassian_ideas_4_desc: "Some times after the founding of Quel'Thalas, many of the high elves grew wary of their rampant use of arcane magic, fearing that it could once more draw the Burning Legion to Azeroth. Dath'Remar Sunstrider sent his most powerful arcanists to find a solution. Over several decades, they built a series of monolithic runestones around Quel'Thalas' borders. This barrier was called Ban'dinoriel, or 'the Gatekeeper' in the high elven tongue. It would prevent others from detecting the high elves' use of magic, ward off the superstitious Amani, and weaken the magic of all non-elves within it."
 thalassian_ideas_5: "New world diplomacy"
 thalassian_ideas_5_desc: "For nearly four thousand years, the high elves remained relatively at peace. But while the elves established their nation, the Amani plotted their next assault. 2,800 years before the First War, they unleashed it upon the high elves. The Troll Wars ignited. Suffering loss after loss, the high elves turned to the humans of Arathor for support. The two formed a military alliance in exchange for the instruction of 100 humans in arcane magic. Together, they crushed the Amani; an empire that had endured for more than twenty thousand years. Humans and high elves have cultivated this alliance ever since."

 demonic_ideas_1_desc: "Sargeras is an old and ancient being - a Titan. Originally he was a planet-sized creature made purely of arcane magic, tasked with keeping Order in the universe. That purpose was eventually twisted into the Burning Crusade. Aeons into his crusade he encountered the magically powerful and technologically advanced Eredar. He cleverly deceived a number of them to join his Legion as Generals, promising power for their allegiance. Those who joined him were corrupted by Fel into the Man'ari demons. These Man'ari became the most powerful agents in the Legion, second only to Sargeras. Archimonde the Defiler and Kil'Jaeden the Deceiver were both Man'ari who offered supreme tactical leadership and personal power to the Legion."
 demonic_ideas_2: "The Burning Crusade"
 demonic_ideas_2_desc: "As a Titan, Sargeras fought many Void demons and imprisoned them in ancient times. When Sargeras looked at the infinite Void from which these demons came, he saw the threat of all Life in the universe being possessed by these demonic Fel powers. If that happened, even the Titans could not stop the corrupt power that would emerge in their universe. Sargeras vowed to destroy all life as an alternative to the corruption, and thus was born the Burning Crusade. Sargeras thought to use his own demon prisoners as an army against all life he would consume. He destroyed the demon's prison to set them free. However, the enormous release of Fel energies stored at the prison warped Sargeras into the incredibly powerful Fallen Fel Titan. He was empowered and emboldened by these infinite powers from the Void. He then began to use the Fel to corrupt warrior races, incorporating them into his newly formed Burning Legion, and then sending those troops to cleanse the planet of life. The Fel influence would grow across the planets themselves until the Energy would rip them apart. The Legion has spent aeons perfecting the art of war, incorporating the best warriors of every planet they have conquered. Planet by planet, the Burning Crusade has now arrived on Azeroth, the final planet to resist the Legion."
 demonic_ideas_3: "Fel Energies"
 demonic_ideas_3_desc: "'A magic unlike any other that feeds on life itself. It promises great power but exacts a great price.' - Medivh    When Sargeras released the demons, he tore a rift in the fabric of the universe directly into the fiery emerald green Void, from which the Fel Energies come. These energies immensely empower their user while simultaneously corrupting their body. Any time the Fel is used the land around also becomes corrupt. The Dark Portal and The Eye of Sargeras both permanently corrupted the land around them with Fel Energies."
 demonic_ideas_4: "Our name is Legion, for we are many"
 demonic_ideas_4_desc: "The ranks of the Burning Legion are constituted of the nearly countless species they have conquered and corrupted across the universe. Some of these Fel-corrupt slave-species include the Man'ari Eredar, the Annihilan, the Nathrezim, the Ered'ruin, Orcs, Ogres, Undead, Imps, Mo'arg, Vrykul, Furbolgs, Voidwalkers, Satyrs, and Arrakoa, just to name a few. In addition to those corrupted by the Fel, the Legion has had many vassals serve them in the past. The Burning Legion was behind the creation of both the Horde and the Scourge. The Horde was manipulated to be the vanguard of the Legion's invasion into Azeroth from Outland, which was quickly falling into Fel destruction. After the failed invasion, the scattered orc tribes pursued various goals apart from the Legion, breaking free of their direct control. Needing a new plan, Sargeras created the enslaved Lich King from a former orc servant of his, Ner'Zhul. The Lich King quickly used his necromantic power to plan his own eventual revolt from the Legion, revolving around the young Prince Arthas Menethil."
 demonic_ideas_5: "The Mighty Infernals"
 demonic_ideas_5_desc: "Few mortals in Azeroth were prepared for the Infernals. Arriving through the skies as fiery-green meteors, these living siege engines were a vanguard of both Sargeras' ancient army and Archimonde's more recent invasionary forces. Few, if any, can stand against the might of the Legion's many Fel constructs. Variations of these constructs include the Infernals, Abyssals, Fel Reavers, Fel Cannons, and Devastators."

 demonic_ideas_6_desc: "An intelligent race of psychic vampires, renowned for their cunning, scheming, and versatility. Also quite renowned for their treachery. While effective intelligent agents and field lieutenants, if given even a bit of power these creatures will try to abuse it. A few Nathrezim were even willing to betray the Legion and Sargeras for their own goals."
 demonic_ideas_7: "The Annihilan and Ered'Ruin"
 demonic_ideas_7_desc: "The powerful Annihilan, commonly referred to as Pit Lords, were some of Sargeras' highest ranking commanders in the Legion. These tough, enormous creatures were capable of inspiring both fear and order on the front lines. Mannoroth the Destructor is the most renowned of their rank. His powerful Fel demon-blood was personally used to corrupt the orcs at two different times. At both times he assumed ownership of all orcs, demanding their subservience whether it was offered or not. The Ered'ruin were a demon race used by the Titans to police users of magic across the cosmos. Sargeras freed these behemoths and formed them into the Doom Guard. They are the enforcers and shock troops of the Legion."

 yaungol_ideas_2_desc:  "In combat, the yaungol prefer to hit hard and fast, making heavy use of cavalry to flank and harass the enemy while hard-hitting infantry assaults the weakest parts of the enemy line."
 yaungol_ideas_3: "Dominance"
 yaungol_ideas_3_desc: "Only the strongest, most courageous, most resilient of yaungol may lead the tribes. These traits are of the highest qualities in yaungol society, and are expected of all yaungol leaders."
 yaungol_ideas_4: "Trapped in a Strange Land"
 yaungol_ideas_4_desc: " Imprisoned in the dangerous Townlong Steppes, the hardy yaungol were forced to adapt, weaponizing local supplies of oil and developing their own aggressive culture. Few races can stand toe-to-toe against the mantid in open ground. For this reason alone, the yaungol survivors are to be feared and respected."
 yaungol_ideas_5: "Ordos"
 yaungol_ideas_5_desc:  "Ordos was once a shaman of the Yaungol who sacrificed himself to the flame, following the promises of the Fire Lords, in order to become a demigod. His flesh is eternally seared with fires, putting him in endless agony. Yaungol Fire-Keepers ritualistically set themselves ablaze to emulate the ascension of Ordos, and cast enchantments and prayers to ease his pain."
 yaungol_ideas_6: "Deceptive Fire Camps"
 yaungol_ideas_6_desc: "It is an old tactic of the yaungol to light more campfires each night than people they have. In this way, enemy spying in the darkness would assume larger numbers of yaungol existed, while their true positions and numbers remained masked."

 mantid_ideas_1_desc: "We are the extension of our Empress's will. Ours is but to serve in Her divine name. Never to question, nor to contemplate; we simply act. We fight, toil, and serve so that Her vision for us is made reality. Her happiness is our reward, her sorrow our failure. We will give our lives for the Empress without hesitation. She is the light, and without Her our lives will be lost to darkness."
 mantid_ideas_2: "The Mantid Swarm"
 mantid_ideas_2_desc:  "We mantid are an elder race. The pandaren you associate with - they are but children. They have their role to play. Each cycle, our young swarm their walls. The pandaren slay the weak. The strong return. With each generation, we grow ever stronger."
 mantid_ideas_3: "Klaxxi Council"
 mantid_ideas_3_desc: "A council of mantid elders known as the Klaxxi are the stewards of mantid history and culture, and their goals are much more long-term than those of the empress. Their will is to preserve the cycle."
 mantid_ideas_4: "Kypari Sap"
 mantid_ideas_4_desc: "Amber is the cornerstone of mantid society. Harvested from the great kypari amber trees, they use this material in their architecture, their art, and their technology. Amber is fashioned by ambersmiths into sharpened blades and weapons."
 mantid_ideas_5: "The Kunchong Cycle"
 mantid_ideas_5_desc:  "The cycle of mantid birthing and building revolves around the kunchong, a colossal insect large enough to threaten whole towns by itself. The mantid revere this enormous creature, and when instinct compels it to stampede throughout the continent, eating earth, trees, and lakes, they follow behind, collecting the amber-colored resin it secretes, birthing their young and creating their homes in its wake. "
 mantid_ideas_6: "Sonic Technology"
 mantid_ideas_6_desc: "Masters of sound, the mantid long ago found a way to use amber to extend the range of their acoustic casting. In this way they are able to communicate over vast distances. No army has successfully marched on mantid lands undetected, and even lone travellers are urged caution as their movements are no doubt being watched the moment they venture beyond the wall."

 sindorei_ideas_5_desc: "The Farstriders are an elite group of blood elf rangers active in Quel'Thalas. They are led by the Ranger-General of Silvermoon, Halduron Brightwing, who succeeded Sylvanas Windrunner after the Third War. The Farstriders are based in Silvermoon City, but they have several camps and lodges scattered all across Quel'Thalas. \"We are rangers sworn to defend our people from enemies both near and far.\" — Lieutenant Dawnrunner "
 sindorei_ideas_6: "Ban'dinoriel and the Runestones"
 sindorei_ideas_6_desc: "Some times after the founding of Quel'Thalas, many of the high elves grew wary of their rampant use of arcane magic, fearing that it could once more draw the Burning Legion to Azeroth. Dath'Remar Sunstrider sent his most powerful arcanists to find a solution. Over several decades, they built a series of monolithic runestones around Quel'Thalas' borders. This barrier was called Ban'dinoriel, or 'the Gatekeeper' in the high elven tongue. It would prevent others from detecting the high elves' use of magic, ward off the superstitious Amani, and weaken the magic of all non-elves within it."
 sindorei_ideas_7: "Grand Magocracy"
 sindorei_ideas_7_desc: "\"The Magisters exact origin and time of ascension to authority are unknown, but it is presumed that they existed maybe before, or during the founding of Quel'Thalas. They have been Silvermoon's top authority on all things pertaining to magic, and have been in possession of a vast reservoir of knowledge on all things arcane, for many years. Like the Farstriders, the Magisters have been a cornerstone of Thalassian society for many years, and a common career choice for studious and ambitious elves. With Silvermoon in shambles it is only natural for them to fill the power vacuum."
